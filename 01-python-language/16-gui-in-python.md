# 16. GUI with Python
There are many Graphical User Interface options for Python users.

It's important to remember that no framework is objectively better than all the others, and different use cases will require different frameworks. 

For instance, if you want to begin GUIs by designing a graphical game, your best bet would be PyGame.

If you want to build web apps, you'll probably want to avoid Python as the GUI and use it for backend work using Flask or Django instead. With web apps you'll want to explore HTML, CSS, and Javascript to provide the GUI for your user.
