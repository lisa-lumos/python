# 8. Errors and Exceptions handling
Someone may use your code in an unexpected way. Error handling can plan for possible errors. With error handling, the code can continue with rest of the code, without having to stop the entire script. 

3 keywords for error handling:
- `try`: the block of code to be attempted
- `except`: the block of code that will be run if the try block has error
- `finally`: the block of code that will always be run, regardless of error
