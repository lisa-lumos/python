# 13. Web scraping with Python
Rules of web scraping:
- Always try to get permission before scraping
- If you make too many scraping attempts, your IP address may get blocked
- Some sites automatically block scraping software

Limitations of web scraping:
- Generally every website is unique, so every web scraping script is unique
- A slight change or update to a website may completely break your web scraping script. 

To web scrape with Python, we can use the BeautifulSoup and requests (to allow for a request to the website) libraries:
- `pip install requests`
- `pip install lxml`
- `pip install bs4`

We can inspect the html elements, and see their classes, for the parts of the website that we are interested in.
