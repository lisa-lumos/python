# Python Notes
Python focuses on optimizing developer time, rather than a computer's processing time. It has documentation at `docs.python.org/3`. 

Python can automate simple tasks: 
- Search for files and editing them
- Scraping info from a website
- Reading and editing excel files
- Work with PDFs
- Automate emails and text messages
- Fill out forms
