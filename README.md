# Python Notes
Python focuses on optimizing developer time, rather than a computer's processing time. It has documentation at `docs.python.org/3`. 

Python can automate simple tasks: 
- Search for files and editing them
- Scraping info from a website
- Reading and editing excel files
- Work with PDFs
- Automate emails and text messages
- Fill out forms

Python can do data science and machine learning tasks:
- Analyze large data files
- Create visualizations
- Perform machine learning tasks
- Create and run predictive algorithms

Python can create websites:
- Use web frameworks such as Django and Flask to handle the backend of a website and user data
- Create interactive dashboards for users

## Installing Python
To install Python, here we will use the free Individual Anaconda distribution - it includes Python and many other useful libraries, including Jupyter Notebook env.
