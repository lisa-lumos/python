# OOP
Python allow users to create their own objects with their own attributes and methods. 

```python
class NameOfClass():
  def __init__(self, param1, param2):
    self.param1 = param1
    self.param2 = param2
  
  def some_method(self):
    print(self.param1)
```

Inheritance: form new classes using classes that have already been defined. 

Polymorphism: different classes can share the same method name, and the methods can be called from the same place, even though different objects can be passed in. 

Special methods allow us to use built in operations in Python, such as length function, or print function, with user created objects.
