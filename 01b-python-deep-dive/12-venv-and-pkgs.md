# 12. Virtual Environments and Packages
## 12.1 Introduction
Python applications often use packages and modules that don't come as part of the standard library. 

Applications will sometimes need a specific version of a library, because the application may require that a particular bug has been fixed, or the application may be written using an obsolete version of the library's interface.

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory tree, that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

Different applications can then use different virtual environments.
