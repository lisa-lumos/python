# 9. Classes
Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.

Python classes provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: - the class inheritance mechanism allows multiple base classes
- a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes
- a method can call the method of a base class with the same name
- objects can contain arbitrary amounts and kinds of data
