# 7. Input and Output
## 7.1 Fancier Output Formatting
Formatted string literals such as `f'Results of the {year} {event}'`. 

To have detailed formatting: `'my_counts: {:-9}, my_percentage: {:2.2%}'.format(my_counts, my_percentage)`. (pads space before number, and convert percentage from decimal to percent format)

### 7.1.1 Formatted String Literals
```py
import math
print(f'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.')

# an integer x after the ':' makes that field to be at least x chars wide
table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}
for name, phone in table.items():
    print(f'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}')

# The = can be used to expand an expression to:
# expression_text = expression_value
bugs = 'roaches'
count = 13
area = 'living room'
print(f'Debugging {bugs=} {count=} {area=}')
# Debugging bugs='roaches' count=13 area='living room'

```

### 7.1.2 The String format() Method
skipped.

### 7.1.3 Manual String Formatting
The `str.rjust(my_width)` method right-justifies a string by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods `str.ljust()` and `str.center()`. 

These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don't truncate it, but return it unchanged.

### 7.1.4 Old string formatting
skipped.

## 7.2 Reading and Writing Files
`open()` returns a file object. `encoding="utf-8"` is recommended unless you know that you need to use a different encoding. 

It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised at some point:
```py
with open('workfile.txt', encoding="utf-8") as f:
    read_data = f.read()

# verify that the file has indeed been automatically closed
f.closed # True
```

If you're not using the "with" keyword, then you should call `f.close()` to close the file and immediately free up any system resources used by it.

### 7.2.1 Methods of File Objects
skipped. 

### 7.2.2 Saving structured data with json
```py
import json
x = [1, 'simple', 'list']
json.dumps(x) # returns json string: '[1, "simple", "list"]'

# write (serialize) to a text file object f
json.dump(x, f)

# deserialize the text file object to memory:
x = json.load(f)

```
