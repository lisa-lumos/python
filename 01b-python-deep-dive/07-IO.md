# 7. Input and Output
## 7.1 Fancier Output Formatting
Formatted string literals such as `f'Results of the {year} {event}'`. 

To have detailed formatting: `'my_counts: {:-9}, my_percentage: {:2.2%}'.format(my_counts, my_percentage)`. (pads space before number, and convert percentage from decimal to percent format)

### 7.1.1 Formatted String Literals
```py
import math
print(f'The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.')

# an integer x after the ':' makes that field to be at least x chars wide
table = {'Sjoerd': 4127, 'Jack': 4098, 'Dcab': 7678}
for name, phone in table.items():
    print(f'{name:10} ==> {phone:10d}')

# The = can be used to expand an expression to:
# expression_text = expression_value
bugs = 'roaches'
count = 13
area = 'living room'
print(f'Debugging {bugs=} {count=} {area=}')
# Debugging bugs='roaches' count=13 area='living room'

```

### 7.1.2 The String format() Method
skipped.

### 7.1.3 Manual String Formatting
The `str.rjust(my_width)` method right-justifies a string by padding it with spaces on the left. There are similar methods `str.ljust()` and `str.center()`. 

These methods do not write anything, they just return a new string. If the input string is too long, they don't truncate it, but return it unchanged.

### 7.1.4 Old string formatting
skipped.
