# 6. Modules
As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you've written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.

To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them elsewhere - a module. definitions from a module can be imported into other modules, or into the main module.

The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Within a module, the module's name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`.
