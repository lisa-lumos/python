# 1. Intro
You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs.

Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. 

Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
- the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation, instead of beginning and ending brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C, it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). 

You can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C, and use it as an extension or command language for that application.
